Track token usage and spending across agents, projects, and the company.

## Report Cost Event

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/cost-events
{
  "agentId": "{agentId}",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "inputTokens": 15000,
  "outputTokens": 3000,
  "costCents": 12
}
```

Typically reported automatically by adapters after each heartbeat.

## Company Cost Summary

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/costs/summary
```

Returns total spend, budget, and utilization for the current month.

For local subscription-backed adapters such as `codex_local`, direct API spend
can remain zero while provider quota is consumed. In that case the summary may
include both:

- `reportedSpendCents` / `reportedBudgetCents`: direct metered/API ledger;
- `spendCents` / `budgetCents`: effective display values, using subscription
  quota-derived plan usage when available;
- `subscriptionSpendCents`, `subscriptionBudgetCents`, and
  `subscriptionUtilizationPercent`: the subscription estimate used by dashboard
  and cost views.

Subscription estimates are operational capacity signals, not proof of provider
invoicing. Metered API integrations should still report explicit `cost_events`.

## Costs by Agent

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/costs/by-agent
```

Returns per-agent cost breakdown for the current month.

## Costs by Project

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/costs/by-project
```

Returns per-project cost breakdown for the current month.

## Budget Management

### Set Company Budget

```
PATCH /api/companies/{companyId}
{ "budgetMonthlyCents": 100000 }
```

### Set Agent Budget

```
PATCH /api/agents/{agentId}
{ "budgetMonthlyCents": 5000 }
```

## Budget Enforcement

| Threshold | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 80% | Soft alert — agent should focus on critical tasks |
| 100% | Hard stop — agent is auto-paused |

Budget windows reset on the first of each month (UTC).
